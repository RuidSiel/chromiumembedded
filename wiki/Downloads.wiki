#summary Location for downloading CEF files.

Binary distributions, which include all files necessary to build a CEF-based application, are available on the [http://www.magpcss.net/cef_downloads/ Downloads] page. Automated nightly builds, available from http://cefbuilds.com, include the newest changes but may not be fully tested. Binary distributions are stand-alone and do not require the download of CEF or Chromium source code. Symbol files for debugging binary distributions of libcef can also be downloaded from the above links.

Release notes for past and current CEF binary distributions are available [http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/wiki/ReleaseNotes here].

Older releases may continue to be available from https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/downloads/list for a limited time.
